# Elm-Resume

Been looking for a project to play around with Elm for a while, so I decided why not a resume web-app? Elm is super fun.

## scripts

### Install

`yarn` -> install dependencies <br>

### Run

`yarn start` -> spool up dev server with elm live in watch mode <br>
`yarn build` -> compile optimized elm output <br>
`yarn minify` -> minify and compress javascript <br>

### Styles

`yarn watch-sass` -> compile and watch scss files <br>
`yarn build-sass` -> compile and compress scss files <br>

## roadmap

- [x] favicon
- [x] frontEnd, backEnd, databases, orms, devtools switch
- [x] more cloud tech
- [x] nav menu button
- [x] svg icons
- [x] technical work experience
- [x] a11y (alt tags svg, keyboard controls, contrast checks)
- [x] dynamic modal for detail content
