# Elm-Resume

Creating an html resume with vanilla html, js, and css is cool, but would make automating any updates a real pain. Because Elm compiles to a single file, and css styles can be inlined, Elm should prove extremely powerful for creating a scriptable resume and still outputing a single file to share.

## scripts

`yarn` -> install dependencies <br>
`yarn start` -> spool up dev server with elm live in watch mode <br>
`yarn sass` -> compile and watch scss files <br>
